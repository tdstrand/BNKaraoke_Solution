    Syncreposod.ps1

    This script performs an initial sync of the repository (source) to your OneDrive folder (destination)
    using robocopy with exclusion switches for unimportant directories and file types.
    
    Then, it sets up a FileSystemWatcher to monitor for changes. Only changes in the important directories
    (listed in $includeDirectories) will trigger another sync.
    
    The script runs continuously until you press "q" to quit.
